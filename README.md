## Call for Papers Manager

> Work in Progress

### Target

This project shall implement a managing tool for call for papers, based on Firebase as its backend.


This can be done via [`app/elements/routing.html`](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/blob/master/app/elements/routing.html). We use Page.js for routing and new routes
can be defined in this import. We then toggle which `<iron-pages>` page to display based on the [selected](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/blob/master/app/index.html#L105) route.

### Why are we using Page.js rather than a declarative router like `<more-routing>`?

`<more-routing>` (in our opinion) is good, but lacks imperative hooks for getting full control
over the routing in your application. This is one place where a pure JS router shines. We may
at some point switch back to a declarative router when our hook requirements are tackled. That
said, it should be trivial to switch to `<more-routing>` or another declarative router in your
own local setup.

### Where can I find the application layouts from your Google I/O 2015 talk?

App layouts live in a separate repository called [app-layout-templates](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-layout-templates).
You can select a template and copy over the relevant parts you would like to reuse to Polymer Starter Kit.

You will probably need to change paths to where your Iron and Paper dependencies can be found to get everything working.
This can be done by adding them to the [`elements.html`](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/blob/master/app/elements/elements.html) import.

### Something has failed during installation. How do I fix this?

Our most commonly reported issue is around system permissions for installing Node.js dependencies.
We recommend following the [fixing npm permissions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md)
guide to address any messages around administrator permissions being required. If you use `sudo`
to work around these issues, this guide may also be useful for avoiding that.

If you run into an exception that mentions five optional dependencies failing (or an `EEXIST` error), you
may have run into an npm [bug](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6309). We recommend updating to npm 2.11.0+
to work around this. You can do this by opening a Command Prompt/terminal and running `npm install npm@2.11.0 -g`. If you are on Windows,
Node.js (and npm) may have been installed into `C:\Program Files\`. Updating npm by running `npm install npm@2.11.0 -g` will install npm
into `%AppData%\npm`, but your system will still use the npm version. You can avoid this by deleting your older npm from `C:\Program Files\nodejs`
as described [here](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6309#issuecomment-67549380).

If you get a browser console error indicating that an element you know you have installed is missing, try deleting the bower_components folder, then run `bower cache clean` followed by `bower install` to reinstall. This can be especially helpful when upgrading from a prior version of the Polymer Starter Kit.

If the issue is to do with a failure somewhere else, you might find that due to a network issue
a dependency failed to correctly install. We recommend running `npm cache clean` and deleting the `node_modules` directory followed by
`npm install` to see if this corrects the problem. If not, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/issues) in case
there is a workaround or fix already posted.

### I'm having trouble getting Vulcanize to fully build my project on Windows. Help?

Some Windows users have run into trouble with the `elements.html` file in their `dist` folder
not being correctly vulcanized. This can happen if your project is in a folder with a name containing a
space. You can work around this issue by ensuring your path doesn't contain one.

There is also an [in-flight](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/issues/62#issuecomment-108974016) issue
where some are finding they need to disable the `inlineCss` option in our configuration for Vulcanize
to correctly build. We are still investigating this, however for the time-being use the workaround if
you find your builds getting stuck here.


### How do I add new JavaScript files to Starter Kit so they're picked up by the build process?

At the bottom of `app/index.html`, you will find a build block that can be used to include additional
scripts for your app. Build blocks are just normal script tags that are wrapped in a HTML
comment that indicates where to concatenate and minify their final contents to.

Below, we've added in `script2.js` and `script3.js` to this block. The line
`<!-- build:js scripts/app.js -->` specifies that these scripts will be squashed into `scripts/app.js`
during a build.

```html
<!-- build:js scripts/app.js -->
<script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/script2.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/script3.js"></script>
<!-- endbuild-->
```

If you are not using the build-blocks, but still wish for additional files (e.g scripts or stylesheets) to be included in the final `dist` directory, you will need to either copy these files as part of the gulpfile.js build process (see the `copy` task for how to automate this) or manually copy the files.

### I'm finding the installation/tooling here overwhelming. What should I do?

Don't worry! We've got you covered. Polymer Starter Kit tries to offer everything you need to build and optimize your apps for production, which is why we include the tooling we do. We realise however that our tooling setup may not be for everyone.

If you find that you just want the simplest setup possible, we recommend using Polymer Starter Kit light, which is available from the [Releases](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/releases) page. This takes next to no time to setup.

## Licensing

Like other Google projects, Polymer Starter Kit includes Google license headers at the top of several of our source files. Google's open-source licensing requires that this header be kept in place (sorry!), however we acknowledge that you may need to add your own licensing to files you modify. This can be done by appending your own extensions to these headers.

## Contributing

Polymer Starter Kit is a new project and is an ongoing effort by the Web Component community. We welcome your bug reports, PRs for improvements, docs and anything you think would improve the experience for other Polymer developers.
